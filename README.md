# CREATIVE CODING EXPERIMENTS

These are some of my coding experiments using tools like [Processing](https://processing.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/), [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), and others, based on my research about [Generative Design](https://github.com/DanielBrito/generative-design), which inspired the creation of the project [Compixelar](https://daniel-brito.blogspot.com/p/compixelar.html).
