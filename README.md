# CREATIVE CODING EXPERIMENTS

These are my creative coding experiments using some technologies that I'm exploring, such as [Processing](https://processing.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/), [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), and others, based on my research about [Generative Design](https://github.com/DanielBrito/generative-design), which inspired the creation of:

[Compixelar](https://medium.com/compixelar) intends to apply some concepts of creative programming on the development of poetic-visual experiments and the composition of multimedia animations.

The name intends to bring up some ideas that express its purpose, such as *pixel*, which is the smallest point that forms a digital image, and *compile*, which can be presented both as a synonym of collect (various artistic creations, in this case) as generate object code that can be interpreted by the computer.
