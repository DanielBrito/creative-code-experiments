# :man_scientist: Creative Coding Experiments

These are my creative coding experiments using technologies such as [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), based on my research about [Generative Design](https://github.com/DanielBrito/generative-design), which inspired the creation of [Compixelar](https://medium.com/compixelar):

**Compixelar** intends to apply some concepts of creative programming on visual experiments and multimedia animations.

The name intends to bring up some ideas that express its purpose, such as _pixel_, which is the smallest point that forms a digital image, and _compile_, which can be presented both as a synonym of collect (various artistic creations, in this case) as generate object code that can be interpreted by the computer.
