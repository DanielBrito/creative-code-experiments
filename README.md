# CREATIVE CODING EXPERIMENTS

These are some of my coding experiments using [Processing](https://processing.org/), [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/) and [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/), based on my research about [Generative Design](https://github.com/DanielBrito/generative-design).
